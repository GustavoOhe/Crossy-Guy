Crossy Guy
Description:
  Small python project, first time experimenting with pygame. 
  Attempted to create a game similar to the popular mobile game "Crossy Road" where the user avoids obstacles and collects points.
Point system:
  User can quit at any time and keep points
  If collision occurs, user's points reset to 0 and game ends
  Points grow exponentially as user passes through levels
How to play:
  Copy code file and png files into your code editor
  Install pygame
  Run the program
  Use up, down, left, and right keys to move
  Space bar ends game and keeps points
  Return key resets game after game over screen is shown
